  category      String   // category (from contractor-plan.md)
  price         Decimal? // price (can be null for "negotiable")
  priceType     String   @default("FIXED") // FIXED, HOURLY, NEGOTIABLE
  duration      Int?     // duration in minutes (optional)
  availability  String   @default("FLEXIBLE") // WEEKDAYS, WEEKENDS, MORNINGS, EVENINGS, FLEXIBLE

  isActive      Boolean  @default(true)

- `PriceDisplay.vue` - price display (with type)


## 4. Validation and Business Logic

### Service Creation Rules

- Only active contractors can create services (status = 1)
- Auto-approval system: all contractor applications immediately approved
- Max 20 active services per contractor
- Service title: 10-100 characters
- Description: 50-2000 characters
- Price: positive number (if specified)

### Booking Rules

- Only authorized users can book
- Cannot book for a past date
- Booking at least 2 hours before the service
- One user can have max 10 active bookings

### Booking Statuses

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The booking system now provides immediate confirmation (as of August 2, 2025)

- `CONFIRMED` - automatically confirmed upon booking (no PENDING status)
- `CANCELLED` - cancelled (by client or contractor)
- `COMPLETED` - service completed

### Booking Flow Changes
- **Before**: User books → PENDING status → Contractor approval → CONFIRMED
- **Now**: User books → CONFIRMED status (immediate)

### Benefits of Immediate Confirmation
- **Improved UX**: Instant booking confirmation
- **Reduced Friction**: No waiting for contractor approval
- **Simpler Workflow**: Streamlined booking process
- **Better Conversion**: Users get immediate gratification

### Technical Notes
- Self-booking prevention remains active
- 2-hour advance booking requirement maintained
- Cancellation policies unchanged
- Legacy PENDING bookings preserved for historical data


## 5. Access Rights and Middleware

### Middleware

- `contractor-required.ts` - check contractor status
- `service-owner.ts` - check service owner
- `booking-participant.ts` - check booking participant

### Access Rights

- Create services: only active contractors (status = 1)
- Edit services: only owner
- View services: all users
- Booking: only authorized clients
- Manage bookings: service owner or client
- Delete contractor profile: only profile owner (cascades to all services)

## 6. Notifications & User Feedback

<!-- Inlined Stage 10 plan below; standalone docs/analytics-plan.md removed -->

<a id="stage-10-analytics-dashboard"></a>
**Stage 10: Analytics Dashboard 📋 PLANNED**

#### Goals
- Provide contractors with actionable insights: bookings, revenue, service performance.
- Start with read-only metrics; expand to trends and comparisons later.

#### MVP Metrics
- Totals (30d and all-time):
  - Bookings count (CONFIRMED/COMPLETED)
  - Revenue (sum of booking.totalPrice where not null)
  - Cancellations count
- Top services by:
  - Bookings count
  - Revenue
  - Average rating (with minimum reviews threshold)
- Trends (last 12 weeks): weekly bookings and revenue

#### API Endpoints
- GET /api/contractor/analytics/summary
  - Query: range = thisWeek | last7d | last14d | last30d | last90d
  - Output: totals (period + allTime), per-service breakdown (top 5), optional sparkline meta
- GET /api/contractor/analytics/trends
  - Query: interval = day | week, from = ISO, to = ISO
  - Output: time series for bookings, cancellations, revenue

Notes:
- Read body first if we later switch to POST; otherwise query params for GET.
- Require auth and contractor ownership checks.

#### Data Model Considerations
- Use existing Booking and Review tables.
- For performance, consider simple materialized views later (out of scope for MVP).

#### Periods & Intervals
Supported ranges and their aggregation in UI/API:
- This week: Monday of the current week up to today (inclusive)
- Last 7 days: rolling last 7 days
- Last 14 days: rolling last 14 days
- Last 30 days: aggregated by week (W1–W5)
- Last 90 days: aggregated by week (W1–W13)

Interval selection used by UI:
- day: thisWeek, last7d, last14d
- week: last30d, last90d

Notes:
- "This week" is calendar-based (Mon→today), not "last 7 days".
- Weekly aggregation shows labels as W1, W2, … with tooltips spanning the week range.

#### UI (Nuxt + DaisyUI)
- Page: /contractor/analytics
- Components:
  - Stats cards (bookings, revenue, cancellations)
  - Top services table
  - Charts: area chart wrapper (ClientOnly) with x/y formatters

Key components (implemented):
- components/charts/BaseAreaChart.vue — generic area chart wrapper with props: data, categories, height, x/y labels, xFormatter, yFormatter; wrapped in ClientOnly to avoid SSR hydration issues
- components/charts/AnalyticsAreaCard.vue — card shell with loading/error states and demo-data fallback

Formatters:
- Bookings y-formatter: "N booking(s)" with pluralization
- Revenue y-formatter: USD currency using en-US locale

Page wiring (pages/contractor/analytics.vue):
- Computes range and chartInterval based on selected range
- Fetches summary and trends using the query params above
- Generates demo data when needed:
  - thisWeek (day): Mon→today
  - last7d (day): last 7 daily points
  - last14d (day): last 14 daily points
  - last30d (week): 5 weekly points
  - last90d (week): 13 weekly points
 - x-axis labels: day (Mon, Tue, …) or week (W1, W2, … with week-range tooltip)

#### Implementation Steps
1) Backend: add summary endpoint with Prisma aggregations.
2) Frontend: basic page with stats cards and top services table.
3) Trends endpoint + simple chart or table.
4) Polish, empty states, loading skeletons, tests.

#### Backend Guidelines
- Nuxt 4 API: For GET we use query; if switching to POST later, always read body before auth
- Single Prisma client instance
- Protect routes with requireAuth and contractor ownership checks
- Handle Zod errors explicitly where validation is applied

#### Testing
- Playwright MCP flows for contractor viewing analytics.
- Seed fixtures to cover high/low cases.

Testing checklist:
- Switch each period and verify labels:
  - This week: Mon→today
  - Last 7 days: 7 day ticks, rolling
  - Last 14 days: 14 day ticks, rolling
  - Last 30/90 days: weekly ticks W1… with week-range tooltip
- Verify y-axis formatters (bookings plural, USD currency)
- Verify charts render only on client (ClientOnly) and no lag

#### Future
- Conversion funnel, cohort analysis, time-to-booking, peak times heatmap.

### 🔮 Future Stages
- Email notification system for booking updates
- Real-time notifications (WebSocket/SSE implementation)
- Payment integration
- Performance optimizations and caching strategies
- Mobile app notifications

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Request Body Reading Order**
When working with Nuxt 4 API endpoints, **always read request body FIRST**:

```typescript
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  try {
    // ✅ CORRECT: Read request body first
    const body = await readBody(event)

    // ✅ CORRECT: Then check authorization
    const session = await requireAuth(event)

    // Rest of the logic...
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
})
```

### Data Validation (Zod Schemas)

```typescript
// Service validation
const serviceSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(10).max(100),
  description: z.string().min(50).max(2000),
  category: z.enum([...categories]),
  price: z.number().positive().optional(),
  priceType: z.enum(['FIXED', 'HOURLY', 'NEGOTIABLE']),
  duration: z.number().positive().optional(),
  availability: z.enum([
    'WEEKDAYS',
    'WEEKENDS', 
    'MORNINGS',
    'EVENINGS',
    'FLEXIBLE',
  ]),
})

// Booking validation
const bookingSchema = z.object({
  serviceId: z.number().positive(),
  scheduledAt: z.date().min(new Date(Date.now() + 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000)), // at least 2 hours from now
  notes: z.string().max(500).optional(),
})

// Contractor application validation
const contractorApplicationSchema = z.object({
  description: z.string().min(10).max(2000),
  categories: z.string().min(1),
  experience: z.string().optional(),
  portfolio: z.string().optional(),
  priceRange: z.string().optional(),
})
```

### Composables & Utilities

```typescript
// composables/useServices.ts - service management
// composables/useBookings.ts - booking management  
// composables/useAuth.ts - authentication state
// composables/useNotifications.ts - notification system
// composables/useDateFormat.ts - date formatting utilities

// utils/priceFormatter.ts - price formatting
// utils/dateTimeUtils.ts - date and time utilities
// utils/availabilityUtils.ts - availability logic
// utils/slotCalculation.ts - time slot calculations
```

### Performance Optimizations

```sql
-- Database indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_service_category ON service(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_service_active ON service(isActive);
CREATE INDEX idx_service_price ON service(price);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_status ON booking(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_scheduled ON booking(scheduledAt);
CREATE INDEX idx_contractor_status ON contractor(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_contractor_availability_day ON contractor_availability(dayOfWeek);
```

### Error Handling Patterns

```typescript
// API Error Handling
try {
  const validatedData = schema.parse(body)
  // Logic...
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 400,
      statusMessage: 'Invalid input data',
      data: error.errors,
    })
  }
  throw error
}

// Frontend Error Handling
const { data, error, pending } = await $fetch('/api/endpoint', {
  onError: (error) => {
    notifications.error('Operation Failed', error.message)
  }
})
```

## 12. Testing & Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
**Mandatory Playwright MCP Testing** for all UI and E2E testing

### Testing Approach
1. **Test-First Development**: Always test existing functionality before building new features
2. **Real Browser Testing**: Use Playwright MCP for comprehensive testing
3. **Issue Documentation**: Create GitHub issues for bugs found during testing
4. **Iterative Development**: Fix issues as discovered, test each fix

### Unit Tests
- Service and booking data validation
- Status and access rights business logic
- Formatting and calculation utilities
- Zod schema validation testing

### API Tests
- Service CRUD operations
- Booking process and validation
- Access rights and authorization
- Search and filtering functionality
- Calendar integration endpoints

### E2E Tests with Playwright MCP
- Service creation by contractor workflow
- Service search and booking by client workflow
- Booking status management across user types
- Different user roles and permissions
- Calendar interaction and booking management

### Playwright MCP Testing Features
- **Real Browser Interaction**: Complete user workflow testing
- **Visual Feedback**: Screenshots and visual validation
- **Network Monitoring**: Request/response analysis
- **Console Capture**: Error detection and debugging
- **Cross-Platform**: Testing across different browsers

### Quality Metrics
- **Booking Success Rate**: Track successful booking completions
- **User Experience**: Page load times and interaction responsiveness
- **Error Rates**: Monitor and reduce API and UI errors
- **System Reliability**: Uptime and performance monitoring
