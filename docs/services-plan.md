# Services Feature Implementation Plan

## 1. Data Model

```prisma
model Service {
  id            Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  contractorId  Int
  contractor    Contractor @relation(fields: [contractorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  title         String   // service title
  description   String   // detailed description
  category      String   // category (from contractor-plan.md)
  price         Decimal? // price (can be null for "negotiable")
  priceType     String   @default("FIXED") // FIXED, HOURLY, NEGOTIABLE
  duration      Int?     // duration in minutes (optional)
  availability  String   @default("FLEXIBLE") // WEEKDAYS, WEEKENDS, MORNINGS, EVENINGS, FLEXIBLE

  isActive      Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt

  bookings      Booking[]

  @@map("service")
}
```

### Booking (service bookings)

```prisma
model Booking {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  serviceId   Int
  service     Service  @relation(fields: [serviceId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  clientId    String
  client      User     @relation(fields: [clientId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  status      String   @default("CONFIRMED") // CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED
  scheduledAt DateTime // when the service is scheduled
  duration    Int?     // actual duration (may differ from Service.duration)
  totalPrice  Decimal? // final price (can be negotiable)
  notes       String?  // additional notes from the client

- `CANCELLED` - cancelled (by client or contractor)
- `COMPLETED` - service completed


## 5. Access Rights and Middleware

### Middleware

- `contractor-required.ts` - check contractor status
- `service-owner.ts` - check service owner
- `booking-participant.ts` - check booking participant

### Access Rights

- Create services: only active contractors (status = 1)
- Edit services: only owner
- View services: all users
- Booking: only authorized clients
- Manage bookings: service owner or client
- Delete contractor profile: only profile owner (cascades to all services)

## 6. Notifications

- `category` - filter by category
- `priceFrom`, `priceTo` - price range
- `availability` - availability
- `contractorId` - services of a specific contractor
- `sortBy` - sorting (price, createdAt, rating)

### Performance Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_service_category ON service(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_service_active ON service(isActive);
CREATE INDEX idx_service_price ON service(price);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_status ON booking(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_scheduled ON booking(scheduledAt);
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Contractor Profile Deletion System

### Overview
The system provides complete contractor profile deletion functionality with cascading service removal. This replaces the previous deactivation system for a more permanent solution.

### Features
- **Complete Profile Removal**: Permanently deletes contractor profile from database
- **Cascading Deletion**: Automatically removes all contractor's services
- **Transaction Safety**: Uses database transactions to ensure data consistency
- **UI Confirmation**: Modal with detailed warnings about permanent deletion
- **Immediate Effect**: Profile removal is instant with UI updates

### API Implementation
```typescript
POST /api/contractor/delete
// Deletes contractor profile and all associated services
// Returns: { success: boolean, deletedServices: number }
```

### Business Logic
1. Verify user owns the contractor profile
2. Start database transaction
3. Delete all contractor's services first
4. Delete contractor profile
5. Commit transaction
6. Return success with deleted services count

### UI Components
- **Delete Button**: Located in contractor profile management
- **Confirmation Modal**: Detailed warning about permanent deletion
- **Success Notification**: Confirms deletion with services count
- **State Reset**: UI reverts to contractor application form

### Security
- Only profile owner can delete their contractor profile
- Requires active authentication session
- Transaction-based deletion prevents partial deletions
- No admin override capability (profile owner only)
