# Services Feature Implementation Plan

## 1. Data Model

### Service (main service model)

```prisma
model Service {
  id            Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  contractorId  Int
  contractor    Contractor @relation(fields: [contractorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  title         String   // service title
  description   String   // detailed description
  category      String   // category (from contractor-plan.md)
  price         Decimal? // price (can be null for "negotiable")
  priceType     String   @default("FIXED") // FIXED, HOURLY, NEGOTIABLE
  duration      Int?     // duration in minutes (optional)
  availability  String   @default("FLEXIBLE") // WEEKDAYS, WEEKENDS, MORNINGS, EVENINGS, FLEXIBLE

  isActive      Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt

  bookings      Booking[]

  @@map("service")
}
```

### Booking (service bookings)

```prisma
model Booking {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  serviceId   Int
  service     Service  @relation(fields: [serviceId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  clientId    String
  client      User     @relation(fields: [clientId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  status      String   @default("PENDING") // PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED
  scheduledAt DateTime // when the service is scheduled
  duration    Int?     // actual duration (may differ from Service.duration)
  totalPrice  Decimal? // final price (can be negotiable)
  notes       String?  // additional notes from the client

  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  @@map("booking")
}
```
