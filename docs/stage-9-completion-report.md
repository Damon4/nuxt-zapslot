# Stage 9: Advanced Search & Filtering — Completion Report

Date: August 8, 2025

## 🎯 Goal
Enhance the public Services catalog with powerful search, filters, sorting, suggestions, and saved searches. Ensure fast responses, intuitive UI, and robust API validation.

## ✅ Completed

- Advanced service search API with comprehensive filters
- UI: Rich filters panel on `/services` with instant feedback
- Sorting: price, createdAt (default), title, rating
- Pagination: preserved with filters and sorting
- Autocomplete suggestions endpoint and UI dropdown
- Saved searches & local history (last 10) with quick reapply
- Rating and review count filters integrated end-to-end
- Location search using contractor service area

## 🧩 Features Overview

- Text search: by title and description (`q`)
- Category filter (`category`)
- Price range filters (`priceFrom`, `priceTo`)
- Availability multi-select (`availability` supports comma-separated values)
- Contractor filter (`contractorId`)
- Minimum rating (`minRating`) and minimum review count (`minReviewCount`)
- Location search (contractor.serviceArea contains)
- Sorting (`sortBy = price | createdAt | title | rating`)
- Pagination (`page`, `limit`)

## 🗂️ Code Changes

### API
- `server/api/services/search.get.ts`
  - Zod-validated query schema
  - Prisma `where` construction with:
    - text search, category, price range
    - availability (single or multi via comma)
    - contractorId, location (serviceArea contains)
  - Rating aggregation in response; optional in-memory filters:
    - `minRating`, `minReviewCount`
  - Sorting by rating supported via post-processing
  - Returns `{ services, pagination }`

- `server/api/services/suggestions.get.ts`
  - Lightweight title suggestions
  - If `q` empty, returns recent titles (createdAt desc)

### Composables
- `composables/useServicesSearch.ts`
  - Reactive params for all filters and sorting
  - Debounced search, page reset on changes
  - Suggestions state and fetcher
  - Saved searches in localStorage (last 10)
  - Computed pagination helper and flags

### UI
- `pages/services/index.vue`
  - Filters UI: search, category, price min/max, availability multi, min rating, min review count, location, sortBy
  - Suggestions dropdown under the search box
  - Clear filters button, pagination controls

## 🔎 API Contracts

`GET /api/services/search`
- Query params: `q, category, location, priceFrom, priceTo, availability, contractorId, minRating, minReviewCount, sortBy, page, limit`
- Response:
```
{
  services: Array<{
    id: number,
    title: string,
    description: string,
    category: string,
    price: number | null,
    priceType: 'FIXED' | 'HOURLY' | 'NEGOTIABLE',
    duration: number | null,
    availability: string,
    contractor: { user: { name: string, image: string | null } },
    bookingsCount: number,
    averageRating: number,
    reviewCount: number,
  }>,
  pagination: { page: number, limit: number, total: number, pages: number }
}
```

`GET /api/services/suggestions`
- Query params: `q?, limit?`
- Response: `{ titles: string[] }`

## 🧪 Testing

- Manual QA across all combinations of filters and sorting
- Playwright MCP checks:
  - Typing in search box shows suggestions
  - Toggling availability multi-select updates results
  - Changing price range narrows results; clearing resets
  - Sorting by rating orders highest first
  - Pagination works with filters preserved

## 📈 Performance & Safety
- Index usage per `docs/services-plan.md` Performance Indexes
- Zod validation on API inputs
- Conservative `limit` defaults and max
- Post-processing for rating filters with recalculated pagination

## 📚 Docs & Links
- Plan: `docs/services-plan.md` (Search and Filtering section)
- API: `server/api/services/search.get.ts`, `suggestions.get.ts`
- UI: `pages/services/index.vue`
- Composable: `composables/useServicesSearch.ts`

## 🔜 Next
- Add geo-aware search (radius) when coordinates available
- Result highlighting for matched terms in cards
- Persist URL params on filter change for shareable searches
