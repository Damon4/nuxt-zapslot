## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```prisma
model Review {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  serviceId Int
  clientId  String
  rating    Int      // 1-5
  comment   String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  service   Service  @relation(fields: [serviceId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  client    User     @relation(fields: [clientId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([serviceId])
  @@index([clientId])
  @@unique([serviceId, clientId])
  @@map("review")
}
```

### Enhanced API Endpoints

#### `/api/services/search.get.ts`
**Enhanced Parameters:**
- `minRating`: Filter services by minimum average rating (1-5)
- `sortBy`: Added "rating" option for highest-rated sorting

**Enhanced Response:**
```typescript
interface ServiceWithRating {
  id: number
  title: string
  description: string
  category: string
  price: number
  averageRating: number  // NEW: Calculated average rating
  reviewCount: number    // NEW: Total review count
  contractor: {
    user: {
      name: string
      image: string
    }
  }
}
```

**Rating Aggregation Logic:**
```typescript
// Rating filtering
if (minRating) {
  const servicesWithRating = await prisma.service.findMany({
    where: {
      ...where,
      reviews: {
        some: {}  // Has at least one review
      }
    },
    include: {
      reviews: true,
      // ... other includes
    }
  })

  // Filter by average rating
  const filteredServices = servicesWithRating.filter(service => {
    const avgRating = service.reviews.reduce((sum, review) => sum + review.rating, 0) / service.reviews.length
    return avgRating >= minRating
  })
}
```

### Frontend Components

#### ServiceCard.vue Enhancements
```vue
<!-- Rating Display -->
<div class="flex items-center gap-2">
  <Icon name="tabler:star-filled" class="text-warning h-4 w-4" />
  <span class="text-sm">
    <span v-if="service.reviewCount > 0" class="font-semibold">
      {{ service.averageRating.toFixed(1) }}
    </span>
    <span v-else class="text-base-content/70">No reviews</span>
    <span v-if="service.reviewCount > 0" class="text-base-content/70 ml-1">
      ({{ service.reviewCount }})
    </span>
  </span>
</div>
```

#### Services Index Page Filter
```vue
<!-- Min Rating Filter -->
<div class="form-control">
  <label class="label">
    <span class="label-text">Min Rating</span>
  </label>
  <select
    v-model="minRating"
    class="select select-bordered"
    @change="handleFilterChange"
  >
    <option value="">Any Rating</option>
    <option value="4">4+ Stars</option>
    <option value="3">3+ Stars</option>
    <option value="2">2+ Stars</option>
    <option value="1">1+ Stars</option>
  </select>
</div>

<!-- Sort by Rating -->
<select v-model="sortBy" class="select select-bordered">
  <option value="createdAt">Newest First</option>
  <option value="rating">Highest Rated</option>
  <option value="price">Price: Low to High</option>
  <option value="title">Alphabetical</option>
</select>
```

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Notes

### Technical Decisions
1. **Rating Precision**: Store as integer (1-5) but display with decimals for averages
2. **Unique Constraint**: One review per client per service prevents spam
3. **Cascade Deletion**: Reviews are automatically cleaned up with parent records
4. **Index Optimization**: Database indexes on serviceId and clientId for fast queries

### Data Integrity
1. **Rating Bounds**: Database constraint ensures ratings are between 1-5
2. **Required Fields**: ServiceId, clientId, and rating are required
3. **Optional Comments**: Comments can be null for rating-only reviews
4. **Timestamp Tracking**: Created and updated timestamps for audit trail

### Performance Considerations
1. **Aggregation Caching**: Could implement rating cache for high-traffic scenarios
2. **Query Optimization**: Indexes support efficient rating-based queries
3. **Pagination**: Rating filters work with existing pagination system
4. **Response Size**: Only essential rating data included in API responses

## âœ… Stage 8 Complete

The Review & Rating System is now fully operational, providing users with:
- **Quality Discovery**: Easy filtering and sorting by service quality
- **Trust Building**: Transparent rating system with real review data
- **Enhanced UX**: Seamless integration with existing service discovery tools
- **Scalable Foundation**: Database schema ready for future review submission features

**Next Priority**: Stage 9 (Advanced Search & Filtering) or Stage 10 (Analytics Dashboard).
